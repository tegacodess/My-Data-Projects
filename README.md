# My Data Science Portfolio ðŸ“Š
Hi. I'm Tega, and this repository is a collation of the projects I'm proud of working on since I started my journey in the data field. I'm a student of Data Science at Axia Africa (Cohort 8). 

The main themes of these projects are: exploratory data analysis, which involves data preparation and understanding, machine learning, and web scraping. This is not a finished repository. It would continue to be updated as I explore and advance in the Data Science field.

Cheers to continual learning!

3. ### Scraping WHO Website
   Scraped data from the WHO website and converted it into a structured Dataframe using Pandas. Then, I exported the data into Excel, CSV, and TSV file formats. This was a really fun task to do.

# My Data Science Portfolio ðŸ“Š
Hi. I'm Tega, and this repository is a collation of the projects I'm proud of working on since I started my journey in the data field. I'm a student of Data Science at Axia Africa (Cohort 8). 

The main themes of these projects are: exploratory data analysis, which involves data preparation and understanding, machine learning, and web scraping. This is not a finished repository. It would continue to be updated as I explore and advance in the Data Science field.

Cheers to continual learning!

## Projects
1. ### Loan Risk Prediction 
    A Binary Classification task aiming to find and predict a customers default risk in loan repayment based on base factors and trends.
   Trained five models and prioritizing recall, chose the best model.

2. ### Predicting Calorie Burn
   Trained four regression models to predict how much calories an individual burns off during exercise. Afterwhich i evaluated the models and chose the best model for this regression task. Then, i deployed the chosen model on Streamlit so it can accept user input and predict exercise.

3. ### Predicting Customer Churn
   Trained four classification models to predict customer churn behaviour based on . After training, I evaluated the models using performance metrics and selected the most suitable one for the task.

5. ### Predicting House Price
   Used regression techniques to predict house prices based on location, size and its amenities. In this project, I included data preprocessing and feature engineering, visualisation to understand the data and model tuning.

6. ### Scraping WHO Website
   Scraped data from the WHO website and converted it into a structured Dataframe using Pandas. Then, I exported the data into Excel, CSV, and TSV file formats. This was a really fun task to do.

7. ### Top 25 Movies: IMDB
   I scraped the IMDB website to get its top 25 movies, obtaining information such as the movie titles, genre(s), actors, etc and stored them in a DataFrame. After which, I exported the data in the CSV, TSV, and Excel file formats.

8. ### Scraping Country Details
   Scraped a website containing a list of countries and their details, transformed the data into a DataFrame and exported it to CSV, TSV, and Excel file formats.
